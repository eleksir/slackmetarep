# minorify some of warnings that are not really critical
[-InputOutput::RequireCheckedClose]
# What can we handle in case of error?

[-Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity]
# Noone cares

[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]
# this policy makes too much false positives

[-RegularExpressions::ProhibitEscapedMetacharacters]
# Looks like it pointless. How can i match simple dot without putting \. in regex? fuck off, man

[-ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
# In short lines we can afford ourselves to use postfix controls
# but ofcorse we should avoid such constructions in long lines.

[-Subroutines::ProhibitSubroutinePrototypes]
# Contrary to  Perl::Critic  we consider prototypes as useful, even if
# the compile-time checks of Perl are not perfect,  Perl may give some
# hints.

[-CodeLayout::RequireTidyCode]
# Impossible to complete, because of on higher linting levels "## no critic..."
# require be per-case on same line where critique is, but tidy align them
# one line down.

[-CodeLayout::ProhibitParensWithBuiltins]
# duh... in some cases it reduces readbility

[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes]
# cause we consider following correct and useful:  my $var = '';
# the recomended use of q{} looks too complex:     my $var = q{};

[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitNoisyQuotes]
# Other people, other opinions: ","  is better readable than qw(,)

[-NamingConventions::Capitalization]
# duh...
# Noone care, really

[-ControlStructures::ProhibitUnlessBlocks]
# They should not be too complex - only one condition should be checked,
# that's all

[-ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumberSeparators]
# Not really

[-InputOutput::RequireBriefOpen]
# Yes, i do!

[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitLongChainsOfMethodCalls]
# But i do really want to use them in JSON::XS declaration!

[-Subroutines::ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef]
# Okay, fuckoff

[-ControlStructures::ProhibitCStyleForLoops]
# But it way much more conventional and less butt-ugly that perlish notaion with $_ as conter var

[-Editor::RequireEmacsFileVariables]
# I don't use it

[-Lax::RequireExplicitPackage::ExceptForPragmata]
# Nope, just nope

[-TooMuchCode::ProhibitUnnecessaryUTF8Pragma]
# no-no-no, i *want* mess up with utf8

[-ValuesAndExpressions::RequireConstantOnLeftSideOfEquality]
# that perlish shit... it makes code weird

[-Lax::ProhibitEmptyQuotes::ExceptAsFallback]
# but i want to use = '' as empty value comparsion!

[-TooMuchCode::ProhibitLargeBlock]
# who say it big?

[-TooMuchCode::ProhibitDuplicateLiteral]
# I want to use = '' multiple times in a row

[-ValuesAndExpressions::RestrictLongStrings]
# Just fuck off
